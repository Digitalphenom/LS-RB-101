Given a set of three values (loan amount, annual apr, loan duration)

User Input
 Get input = name
 Is name_valid?
 Get input = annual apr
 Is number_valid?
 Get input = annual_apr
 Is number_valid?
 Get input = loan_duration

1. Convert annual apr to float by dividing by 100
2. Take that value then divide by loan_duration to get your monthly interest rate
3. Multiply loan_amount by monthly_ir.
4. The result will give your monthly ir payment.
