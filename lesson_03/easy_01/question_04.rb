# What do the methods delete_at() and delete() do?

# the delete_at method takes a single argument and returns self removing the value supplied to it by index.
# delete takes a single argument and returns self removing the value supplied to it in literal form.
# They both appear to be bang equivalents even tho they are invoked
#with the ! operator.
# They both take single arguments and cannot be invoked without arguments.
